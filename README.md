# simple_autodiff
The goal of this project is to recreate a simple automatic differentiation algorithm.<br>

## Work in progress
For the moment my algorithm handle only simple function that are compositions of sums, products and powers of variables, e.g. $f(a,b)=(a+b)b^a$ or $f(a,b,c) = ab+bc+a^{b^c}$
